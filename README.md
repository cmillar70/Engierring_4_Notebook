## Hello_World

### Assignment Description

For this assignment, I used basic python to print "Hello, World" 10 times.

### Reflection

This was a nice refresher for basic python. I used a while loop to print it exactly 10 times by starting at 1 and adding 1 for every loop and then stopping it at 11.

## Dice_Roller

### Assignment Description

For this assignment, I used python to automatically print dice rolls with a random number command.

### Screenshots

### Reflection

The "roll again?" was pretty difficult to figure out. All i really needed to do was loop all the code as long as I kept pressing enter. It also stops if you press X instead.

## Basic_Calculator

### Assigment Description

For this assignment, I created a calculator that when given two numbers, will show the sum, difference, product, quotient, and modulo.

### Reflection

I couldn't figure out by myself how to properly define the "domath" function. All you really need is a variable to make a function. Each time the value changes you return a different string.

## Quadratic_Calculator

### Assignment Description

For this assignment, I ceated a more advanced calclator that uses the discriminant and quadratic formula to find all real roots of a quadratic function when given the coefficients of ax^2 + bx + c

### Screenshots

### Reflection

The most difficult part was trying to make it only run the commands if it needed to because otherwise it would have an error. I had to import the square root function because python doesn't support it by default. I used the discriminant to calculate the number of real roots and then used the quadatic formula to solve those roots.

## Strings_and_Loops

### Assignment Description

For this assignment, I used for loops to break a sentence into words and then break those words into letters, and then list the letters.

### Screenshots

### Reflection

This was relatively easy once I figured out the split command. I split the phrase into words and then split the words into letters. then I printed the phrase letter by letter with dashes in between each word

## Hangman

### Assignment Description

I had to code the basic game "Hangman". This was the hardest assignment yet, I don't think I would've been able to do it without help. 

### Screenshots

### Reflection

This assignment was very difficult but once I figured out how to make the letters fill in the blanks it was easy. I couldn't fit all my code into the screenshots so I picked a specific part to demonstrate.

## Skateboard

### Assignment Description

This is my first cad assignment for this year. It took me through a full tutorial on how to use many of the common tools in onshape. I built all the parts one by one and then assembled them to form a very bright colored skateboard.

### Reflection

This assignment took me the longest out of every assignment so far and it was hard to stay focused but they explained perfectly how to do every little thing and I still managed to mess up something with the materials because I ended up with lots of incorrect masses.

## Lego Bricks

### Assignment Description

I used variables and configurations to make different kinds of lego bricks. I also assembled them into a duck and even made an assembly manual

### Reflection

All of the CAD assignments so far have provided exremely descriptive tutorials on how to use various tools to acomplish exactly what you need to do. I got the right answers by just following the instructions.
