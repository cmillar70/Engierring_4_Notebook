## Hello_World

### Assignment Description

For this assignment, I used basic python to print "Hello, World" 10 times.

### Screenshots

### Reflection

This was a nice refresher for basic python. I used a while loop to print it exactly 10 times by starting at 1 and adding 1 for every loop and then stopping it at 11.

## Dice_Roller

### Assignment Description

For this assignment, I used python to automatically print dice rolls with a random number command.

### Screenshots

### Reflection

The "roll again?" was pretty difficult to figure out. All i really needed to do was loop all the code as long as I kept pressing enter. It also stops if you press X instead.

## Basic_Calculator

### Assigment Description

For this assignment, I created a calculator that when given two numbers, will show the sum, difference, product, quotient, and modulo.

### Screenshots

<img src="https://github.com/cmillar70/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/screenshots/basic_calc_out.png?raw=true" alt="basic_calc_out.png"/>

### Reflection

I couldn't figure out by myself how to properly define the "domath" function. All you really need is a variable to make a function. Each time the value changes you return a different string.

## Quadratic_Calculator

### Assignment Description

For this assignment, I ceated a more advanced calclator that uses the discriminant and quadratic formula to find all real roots of a quadratic function when given the coefficients of ax^2 + bx + c

### Screenshots

<img src="https://github.com/cmillar70/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/screenshots/quad_calc_in.png?raw=true" alt="quad_calc_in.png"/>

<img src="https://github.com/cmillar70/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/screenshots/quad_calc_out.png?raw=true" alt="quad_calc_out.png"/>

### Reflection

The most difficult part was trying to make it only run the commands if it needed to because otherwise it would have an error. I had to import the square root function because python doesn't support it by default. I used the discriminant to calculate the number of real roots and then used the quadatic formula to solve those roots.

## Strings_and_Loops

### Assignment Description

For this assignment, I used for loops to break a sentence into words and then break those words into letters, and then list the letters.

### Screenshots

<img src="https://github.com/cmillar70/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/screenshots/str_and_lps_out.png?raw=true" alt="str_and_lps_out.png"/>

### Reflection

This was relatively easy once I figured out the split command. I split the phrase into words and then split the words into letters. then I printed the phrase letter by letter with dashes in between each word

## Hangman

### Assignment Description

I had to code the basic game "Hangman". This was the hardest assignment yet, I don't think I would've been able to do it without help. 

### Screenshots

<img src="https://github.com/cmillar70/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/screenshots/hangman_out.png?raw=true" alt="hangman_out.png"/>

### Reflection

This assignment was very difficult but once I figured out how to make the letters fill in the blanks it was easy. I couldn't fit all my code into the screenshots so I picked a specific part to demonstrate.

## Skateboard

### Assignment Description

This is my first cad assignment for this year. It took me through a full tutorial on how to use many of the common tools in onshape. I built all the parts one by one and then assembled them to form a very bright colored skateboard.

### Screnshots

The final assembly of all parts

### Reflection

This assignment took me the longest out of every assignment so far and it was hard to stay focused but they explained perfectly how to do every little thing and I still managed to mess up something with the materials because I ended up with lots of incorrect masses.

## Lego_Bricks

### Assignment Description

I used variables and configurations to make different kinds of lego bricks. I also assembled them into a duck and even made an assembly manual.

### Screenshots

<img src="https://github.com/cmillar70/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/screenshots/lego4.png?raw=true" alt="lego4.png"/>

### Reflection

All of the CAD assignments so far have provided exremely descriptive tutorials on how to use various tools to acomplish exactly what you need to do. I got the right answers by just following the instructions.
 
## Multi-tool

### Assignment Description

I designed a multi-tool in onshape and cut it nto acrylic with a laser cutter. It has measurements for inches, centimeters, a wrench, and even a few angles

### Screenshots

<img src="https://github.com/cmillar70/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/screenshots/multitool1.png?raw=true" alt="multitool1.png"/>

<img src="https://github.com/cmillar70/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/screenshots/multitool3.png?raw=true" alt="multitool3.png"/>

### Reflection

This series of assignments went by relatively fast and only took me a single class period to complete. The hardest part was dimensioning all the individual holes to line up just right. But even for that, all I really had to do was follow the image as a guide and it worked out easily.

## LED_Blink

### Assignment Description

I used my Raspberry Pi to made two small led lights alternate blinking.

### Screenshots

<img src="https://github.com/cmillar70/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/screenshots/led_blink.png?raw=true" alt="led_blink.png"/>

### Reflection

After shortening all the long commands into variables and importing various libraries it was just a basic refresher for beginner wiring.

## Shutdown_Button

### Assignment Description

I set up a button to shutdown my py for any wireless assignments where it won't be plugged in to my pc.

### Screenshot

The part that controls whether it restarts or shuts down based on how long you hold it

### Reflection 

This assignment was following an online tutorial with code that someone else made. It is a very helpful tool. There is one part that I messed up on where I accidently made a typo in the rc.local file. But I fixed that and it was my only problem.

## GPIO_Pins

### Assignment Description

I wired an accelerometer and printed the values on an oled screen

### Screenshots

### Wiring
<img src="https://github.com/cmillar70/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/Wiring/GPIO_Pins_wiring.jpg?raw=true" alt="GPIO_Pins_wiring.jpg"/>


### Reflection

This was the most difficult assignment yet and took me 6 classes to complete. I took code from two librbaries and mixed them together. It took me 6 classes to realise that I need to shorten the text and variable into a single string to be able to print it.

## Accel_Bubble

### Assignment Description

I used an accelerometer to measure which way the circuit was moving across a single axis and then printed that on an oled screen. I also made it wireless by using a battery and my shutdown button.

### Picture

### Reflection

Getting my shutdown button to work was the most difficult part. But, I just went back to my original shutdown button assignment and found the issue.

## Camera_test

### Assignment Description

This was my first assignment using a camera with the raspberry pi. For the first part I just figured out how to take a picture, but with the second part I took five pictures and used a different filter over each image.

### Pictures

Extremely complicated wiring for this assignmnet.

My python folder after an unsuccessful attempt to take the pictures in another directory (I had to delete them all manually).

<img src="https://github.com/cmillar70/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/pics/camera_test_accident.png?raw=true"/>

### Reflection 

This assignment was one of the easiest yet. There was no challenge with the wiring and the code was primarily just an easy copy and paste from an online tutorial linked in the assignment.

## Copypasta

### Assignment Description

I used the camera on my raspberry pi to take a few pictures and then compile them into a video. 

### Evidence 

there is really nothing noteworthy for this assignment, I just followed a tutorial here:
https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/push-button-stop-motion

### Reflection 

This assignment was generally very easy, I encountered one problem with the command that named the files. I just needed to declare the variable keeping track of the frame as a string instead of an integer with str().
