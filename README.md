## Hello_World

### Assignment Description

For this assignment, I used basic python to print "Hello, World" 10 times.

### Reflection

This was a nice refresher for basic python.

## Dice_Roller

### Assignment Description

For this assignment, I used python to automatically print dice rolls with a random number command.

### Reflection

The "roll again?" was pretty difficult to figure out.

## Basic_Calculator

### Assigment Description

For this assignment, I created a calculator that when given two numbers, will show the sum, difference, product, quotient, and modulo.

### Reflection

I couldn't out by myself how to properly define the "domath" function.

## Quadratic_Calculator

### Assignment Description

For this assignment, I ceated a more advanced calclator that uses the discriminant and quadratic formula to find all real roots of a quadratic function when given the coefficients of ax^2 + bx + c

### Reflection

The most difficult part was trying to make it only run the commands if it needed to because otherwise it would have an error.

## Strings_and_Loops

### Assignment Description

For this assignment, I used for loops to break a sentence into words and then break those words into letters, and then list the letters.

### Reflection

This was relatively easy once I igured out how strings worked.
